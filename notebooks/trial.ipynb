    "You will be provided with a job description by the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step guide on how to write and structure an effective cover letter:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Header**:\n",
    "   - Include your contact information at the top of the page. This should include your name, address, phone number, and email address.\n",
    "   - Include the date you are writing the cover letter, followed by the employer's contact information (if you have it) below your information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Salutation**:\n",
    "   - Address the hiring manager or relevant person by their name. If you don't know their name, use a generic greeting like \"Dear Hiring Manager\" or \"To Whom It May Concern.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Opening Paragraph**:\n",
    "   - Begin with a strong opening sentence that expresses your interest in the specific position and company.\n",
    "   - Mention how you heard about the job or why you're interested in the company.\n",
    "   - Briefly introduce yourself and state your current role or status.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Body Paragraph**:\n",
    "   - This is where you'll make your case for why you're the ideal candidate.\n",
    "   - Highlight your relevant skills, experiences, and achievements that match the job requirements. Be specific and use quantifiable examples when possible.\n",
    "   - Show how your qualifications align with the company's values, mission, and needs. Research the company thoroughly to demonstrate your knowledge.\n",
    "   - Tailor each paragraph to address the key qualifications listed in the job description.\n",
    "   - Show enthusiasm and passion for the role and company.\n",

    "\n",
    "7. **Signature**:\n",
    "   - Below your closing, leave space for your handwritten signature if you are submitting a physical copy. If submitting electronically, type your name.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Optional: Postscript (P.S.)**:\n",
    "   - Consider adding a postscript to reiterate a key point or express your enthusiasm once more. For example, you might say, \"P.S. I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute to [Company's] innovative projects.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Length and Format**:\n",
    "   - Keep your cover letter concise, typically one page in length.\n",
    "   - Use a clean, professional font and format. Ensure it's easy to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Proofread and Edit**:\n",
    "    - Carefully proofread your cover letter for grammar and spelling errors. You can also ask someone else to review it for you.\n",
    "    - Ensure the letter is tailored to the specific job and company.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Customization**:\n",
    "    - Customize each cover letter for the job you're applying to. Generic cover letters are less effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Follow-Up**:\n",
    "    - If possible, follow up with the employer after submitting your application to express your continued interest.\n",
    "\n",
